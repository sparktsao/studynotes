## Attention Is All You Need
    - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf
    - An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,
        where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum
        of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the
        query with the corresponding key
