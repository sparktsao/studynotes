Attention model
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf
- An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,
where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum
of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the
query with the corresponding key
